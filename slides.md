# Before relational model


- Nothing
- Nearly...
- Really difficult, 1 model = 1 program
- Hierarchical model developed by IBM

layout: two-cols

# Drawbacks

- One parent per child.
- Complex (users require physical representation of database)
- Navigation system is complex.
- Data must be organized in a hierarchical way without compromising the information.
- Lack structural independence.
- Many too many relationships not supported.

::right::

# Advantages

- Have many different structures and forms.
- Structures data in an upside-down tree. (Simplifies data overview)
- Manages large amounts of data.
- Express the relationships between information.
- Many children per parent.
- Distribute data in terms of relationships.
- Improve data sharing.
