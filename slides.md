# Before relational model


- Nothing
- Nearly...
- Really difficult, 1 model = 1 program
- Hierarchical model developed by IBM 




---
layout: two-cols
---

# Drawbacks

- One parent per child.
- Complex (users require physical representation of database)
- Navigation system is complex.
- Data must be organized in a hierarchical way without compromising the information.
- Lack structural independence.
- Many too many relationships not supported.

::right::

# Advantages

- Have many different structures and forms.
- Structures data in an upside-down tree. (Simplifies data overview)
- Manages large amounts of data.
- Express the relationships between information.
- Many children per parent.
- Distribute data in terms of relationships.
- Improve data sharing.

# Relational Algebra

- Computer Science operate on data with type (integer, booelan, character, string...)
- Attribue is constraint by a type

- Relational Algebra define a domain = type

$$
\begin{array}{c}

\nabla \times \vec{\mathbf{B}} -\, \frac1c\, \frac{\partial\vec{\mathbf{E}}}{\partial t} &
= \frac{4\pi}{c}\vec{\mathbf{j}}    \nabla \cdot \vec{\mathbf{E}} & = 4 \pi \rho \\

\nabla \times \vec{\mathbf{E}}\, +\, \frac1c\, \frac{\partial\vec{\mathbf{B}}}{\partial t} & = \vec{\mathbf{0}} \\

\nabla \cdot \vec{\mathbf{B}} & = 0

- 1994 he was inducted as a Fellow of the Association for Computing Machinery

## Codd is now an award 

- **SIGMOD Edgar F. Codd Innovations Award**
: *is a lifetime research achievement award given by the ACM Special Interest Group on Management of Data*
- The annual ACM SIGMOD Conference, which began in 1975, is considered one of the most important in the field of data management.
